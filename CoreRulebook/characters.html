      <p>
        Welcome to character creation in Light Omens. Here, every choice shapes
        not only your character’s journey but also the legacy they leave behind.
        In the world of Light Omens, heroes, adventurers, and scholars often
        leave their mark on those who follow. Whether through Reminiscent Bonds
        with companions or Memorial Bonds with the fallen, your character’s
        story can inspire future generations. As you build your character,
        consider the impact they hope to have and how their memory might guide
        others, even when they are no longer there to lead. You’re not just
        creating a character for one adventure—you’re shaping a piece of the
        world’s history.

      <h2>Approaches</h2>
      <p>
        A character’s approaches stand for a character’s training and
        understanding. They express how effective a character is in a specific

      </p>
      <p>
        Below are examples of what a character might accomplish at each level of

      </p>

          <tr>
            <td><strong>Force</strong></td>
            <td>Clumsy with power; struggles to lift or break things.</td>

            <td>
              Unmatched grace, able to move undetected or influence easily.

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>Force</h3>
      <p>
        Force represents direct, straightforward action. Characters using Force
        rely on physical power, brute strength, or straightforward
        problem-solving.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Force</h4>
      <p>
        Use Force when time is of the essence, or when the situation requires
        immediate, impactful action that bypasses complexity. Force works best
        when subtlety isn’t necessary, or when brute strength or decisiveness
        will achieve results more efficiently.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Combat: Swinging a weapon with all your might to deal maximum damage.
        </li>
        <li>
          Physical Challenges: Forcing open a locked door, lifting a heavy
          object, or breaking through obstacles.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social Interactions: Being blunt, using intimidation, or leveraging
          sheer confidence to impose your will.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Finesse</h3>
      <p>
        Finesse involves precision, skill, and subtlety. This Approach
        emphasizes agility, accuracy, and careful planning.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Finesse</h4>
      <p>
        Finesse is ideal for situations where control and accuracy are crucial.
        When a plan needs subtlety or a delicate touch—or when you want to
        achieve a goal without creating unnecessary chaos—Finesse is the go-to
        Approach.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Combat: Striking vital points with precision, dodging, or using
          agility to outmaneuver an opponent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Physical Challenges: Balancing, climbing, or performing delicate
          maneuvers that require fine motor skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social Interactions: Using charm, diplomacy, or subtle manipulation to
          persuade others.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Focus</h3>
      <p>
        Focus represents resilience, patience, and endurance. Characters using
        Focus rely on their ability to maintain control and stay persistent
        through difficulty.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Focus</h4>
      <p>
        Use Focus in situations that demand sustained effort or where a calm,
        controlled approach can prevent errors or fatigue. It’s especially
        useful when staying power and resilience are more valuable than speed or
        power.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Combat: Withstanding attacks, maintaining a defensive stance, or
          fighting in a disciplined manner to wear down the opponent.
        </li>
        <li>
          Physical Challenges: Enduring long-term strain, holding steady under
          physical pressure, or remaining poised in high-stakes situations.
        </li>
        <li>
          Social Interactions: Staying calm under pressure, resisting
          manipulation, or remaining composed in intense conversations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Approach</th>
            <th>Key Traits</th>
            <th>Lockdown Effect</th>
            <th>Adaptation Suggestions</th>

            <td>Direct, impactful</td>
            <td>Weakened (Force unavailable)</td>
            <td>Use Finesse for agility or Focus for resilience</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Finesse</strong></td>
            <td>Precise, subtle</td>
            <td>Clumsy (Finesse unavailable)</td>
            <td>Use Force for power or Focus for steadiness</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><strong>Focus</strong></td>
            <td>Resilient, controlled</td>
            <td>Distracted (Focus unavailable)</td>
            <td>Use Finesse for avoidance or Force for quick action</td>
          </tr>

      <p>
        Specialties stand for a character’s general behavior. They express how
        particular a character is in a specific action. Each specialty is a
        specific combination of an attribute and an approach. Each specialty has
        a ranking from 0 to 6. Ranks in a specialty allow you to upgrade your
        base dice pool. When rolling for a Specialty action, replace up to [X]
        d6 in your dice pool with d12s, where X is the lower of your Specialty
        rank and your Attribute rating. You can never upgrade more dice than
        your attribute and cannot upgrade any dice if you are hopeless.

      </ul>

      <h2>Hope</h2>
      <p>
        Player characters have access to a personal resource called Hope. Hope
        stands for the elements that make them stand out. Hope allows a
        character to push their limits and achieve grand feats. Characters may
        alter the world around them and avoid negative consequences. Characters
        may have abilities that need Hope to perform them. Hope is the extent of
        a character's will on the world and will to live.
      </p>
      <h3>Spending Hope</h3>
      <p>
        Each player character has their own Hope pool set up during character
        creation. There are a few ways a character may spend their Hope.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Upgrade Dice. A character may spend Hope to upgrade a single d6. This
          choice can only apply to the value of the character’s Approach. This
          costs one Hope per upgrade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reroll Dice. A character may spend Hope to reroll up to two dice in
          their dice pool. This costs one Hope.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid Injury. A character may spend Hope to negate a negative
          consequence or impending Injury. Each Injury varies on the Hope cost.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talents. Characters may learn Talents that offer extra ways to spend
          Hope.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hopelessness</h3>
      <p>
        Hopeless is a Truth that occurs when a character’s Hope reaches 0.
        Hopelessness is temporary and occurs if characters push themselves too
        far. A character can choose one of the different forms of hopelessness
        when their Hope becomes 0. Hopeless characters lock down one approach
        depending on the type of hopelessness. A character cannot use any d6s
        from their approach and cannot upgrade any dice with that approach.
        Hopeless characters also generate one Complication when using any
        alternative approach. A hopeless character cannot regain Hope by
        spending Harmony or generating Chaos. Regaining Hope doesn’t remove a
        character’s hopeless state.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Weakened characters lock down their Force approach. The character can
          no longer rely on direct, powerful actions. Physically intense tasks
          become exhausting or impossible, and their intimidation tactics lose
          impact. This forces the character to adapt by relying on more subtle
          or enduring methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clumsy characters lock down their Finesse approach. The character
          struggles with precision, losing their ability to perform delicate
          tasks or agile maneuvers. They may have to resort to brute strength or
          simply tough it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Distracted characters lock down their Focus approach.The character
          finds it difficult to stay composed, losing their endurance and
          resilience. They may struggle to hold their ground and can be more
          easily shaken.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Handling Hopelessness</h4>
      <p>
        A character loses the hopeless state after completing any rest. An ally
        can remove a character’s hopeless state using a Plan and Prepare action
        to affect a Truth. Affecting the hopeless state is a Difficulty 2 Test.
        Removing the hopeless state from any ally recovers one Hope for each
        character involved. A character who gains the hopeless state gains
        experience. A character who helps another recover from the hopeless
        state also gains experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Technique Level</h2>
      <p>
        Every character has a Technique Level (TL). TL describes a character’s
        affinity to develop or interact with objects with varying complexities.
        This applies to physical objects, magical elements, and technical
        aspects of the world. Characters can interact with any objects with a
        Complexity lower than or equal to their TL. Tests may still be necessary
        in difficult or dangerous situations.
      </p>

      <h3>Complicated Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        Characters without the proper TL face increased challenges when using an
        object. The Difficulty of a Test interacting with the object increases
        by +2 for each difference. A character may try to interact with the
        object with help. Only a character with the proper Technique Level may
        function as an assistant. The difficulty of the Test is only increased
        by +1 for each level difference. Characters trying to use an object
        without the Technique Level also generate Chaos. The Chaos generated
        equals the difference between the Complexity and the Technique Level.
      </p>
      <h4>Collaborative Techniques</h4>
      <p>
        A character may train another character on how to use an object during a
        Long Rest. The trainer must have a Technique Level high enough to use
        the object. The receiving character must have a Technique Level lower
        than that of the object. The receiving character receives the mentored
        truth. They treat the Technique Level for the object as one lower level.
        A character may only have the mentored truth for a single object.

      </p>

      <h2>Resource Points</h2>
      <p>
        Every character collects salvaged components, harvested materials, or
        residual arcane energy. These resources may assemble into tools, items,
        or situational effects. Player characters have a pool of Resource Points
        to stand for this.
      </p>

      <h3>Using Resource Points</h3>
      <p>
        A character may declare they have resources that help when acting. They
        may declare this regardless of whether the action requires a Test. A
        character describes the resource they are revealing, crafting, or
        conjuring. The Game Master (GM) decides how many Resource Points the
        creation requires. The character gains the object as equipment Truth if
        they have enough resources to pay the price. The character may try to
        resolve the action with the new object. A character cannot spend more
        Resource Points than their Technique Level on a single creation.
        Anything created this way has a Complexity level equal to one less the
        cost. Also, anything created using Resource Points breaks down at the
        end of the scene.
      </p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Gathering Resource Points</h3>
      <p>
        Once per scene, a player may request to gather resources. They decide
        whether to gather from natural, magical, or industrial sources. A
        character must make an Attribute (Force / Finesse) Test with a
        Difficulty of 1. On success, the character gains resources equal to the
        number of dice rolled for the check (+1 for each d12 rolled). A
        character may spend one Harmony to increase the amount gained by +1.
        Places scarce in a specific resource may reduce the amount gained in
        half (rounded up). Locations with plenty of specific resources may
        double the amount gained. Any Resource Points a character gains above
        their baseline creates the encumbered Truth. A character can only carry
        a Resource Points equal to twice their baseline.
      </p>
      <h2>Bonds</h2>
      <p>
        Every player character has some connection to other group members. Two
        kinds of bonds form a Truth: friendships and rivalries. A character
        receives one or more bonds during character creation. These bonds aid in
        connecting the player characters within a group. These bonds help
        characters recover Hope while providing Truth.
      </p>

      <h3>Friendships</h3>
      <p>
        If a character has a friendly bond with another character, they tend to
        be more likely to help the other. When a character spends Harmony to
        Gain Favor or provides Hope during a rest for a friend, that ally
        regains +1 extra Hope.
      </p>

      <h3>Rivalries</h3>
      <p>
        If a character has a rivalry bond with another character, they tend to
        push one another to improve. When a character regains Hope by generating
        Chaos to Tempt Fate or spending Harmony to Gain Favor, their rivals
        regain +1 Hope.
      </p>
      <h2>Talents</h2>
      <p>
        A character’s attributes, approaches, and methods do not explain all
        that they are. Talents are extra benefits and abilities of a character.
        Each one grants some mechanical benefits that apply within a set of
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <h2>Putting it Together</h2>
      <p>
        When a player creates a character for Light Omens RPG, follow the
        following steps.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Select a single Origin for the character. The origin describes where
          the character came from. This is a cultural aspect more than anything.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select an Archetype for the character. The archetype describes what
          the character does. This is about their career and primary skill set.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select a Tendency for the character. The tendency describes the
          character’s default behavior.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These three elements describe a character; you are a(n) tendency +
        origin + archetype.
      </p>

      <h2>Origins</h2>
      <p>

      <h3>Unknown Origins</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes a character has mysterious origins. They could have amnesia,
        lost access to their original form, or otherwise not be part of this
        world. This means the character starts without using one of the
        established origins available. This is an advanced choice; a player
        should get the Game Master's (GM's) permission first. The character
        starts with 16 experiences to spend. These points may only increase
        Attributes, Technique Level, Hope, and Resources. Additionally, the
        character may choose one Special Ability from any available origin.
      </p>

      <h2>Archetypes</h2>
      <p>
        Archetypes describe the training that a character has experienced in
        recent years. These are distinct from a character’s culture and have
        several influences. The starting archetypes of LIGHT OMENS RPG are
        arbiter, broker, harvester, runner, vanguard, and wright. Each archetype
        provides a base set of benefits:

      <h3>Unusual Archetypes</h3>
      <p>
        There are some characters that get unique training over their life. They
        could have a special mentor, borrow knowledge, or otherwise not be part
        of this world. This means the character starts without using one of the
        established origins available. This is an advanced choice; a player
        should get the Game Master's (GM's) permission first. The character
        starts with 14 experiences to spend. These points may only increase
        Approaches, Technique Level, Hope, and Resources. Additionally, they
        start with two Talents of their choice from the General Talents. Such a
        character does not begin with any goals, wealth, or equipment. The GM
        may choose to provide wealth or equipment.
      </p>

      <h2>Tendencies</h2>
      <p>
        Tendencies are not personalities but more character behaviors. The
        available tendencies are aggressive, analytical, devious, empathetic,
        expressive, or stubborn. Each tendency provides a base set of benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Truth. The character gains a single Truth, usually the name of the
          tendency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Specialty. The character’s specialties start with 0 ranks. The
          tendency provides the character with a single Specialty rank related
          to a specific approach.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bond. The character starts with several bonds. One of the starting
          bonds must be a specific type.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drive. The tendency provides the character with a specific behavior
          that gives a personal way to recover Hope.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hopelessness. The tendency has a particular type of Hopelessness that
          a character experiences from reduced to zero Hope.
        </li>
        <li>
          Flaw. The tendency provides the character with a specific behavior
          that gives a personal way to gain experience.

      <h2>Expanding Characters</h2>
      <p>
        Once you have your origin, archetype, and tendency, it is time to finish
        the final details. Also, explore the ways to improve your character
        moving forward.
      </p>
      <h3>Calculating Hope</h3>
      <p>
        You should have your maximum Hope value. This equals the number of your
        specialty [Attribute (Approach)] chosen from your tendency. Any bonuses
        from your origin and archetype further increase it. Remember, characters
        all have a starting +1 for their Hope.
      </p>

      <h3>Calculating Resource Points</h3>
      <p>
        You should have your baseline Resources value. This equals the bonuses
        gained from your origin and archetype. Remember, characters all have a
        starting +2 for their baseline Resources.
      </p>

      <h3>Establishing Bonds</h3>
      <p>
        The number of bonds you have depends on the number of players in the
        group. Your tendency is either based on friendship or rivalry. Choose
        one other player character in the group to share a bond with that type.
        This bond goes both ways and is the same for both characters. Any
        subsequent bonds gained by any characters can be a friendship or
        rivalry.
      </p>

        <tr>
          <th>Numberof PCs</th>
          <th>Starting Number of Bonds per PC</th>

          <td>1</td>
        </tr>

          <td>6+</td>
          <td>3</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <h3>Starting Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        Your chosen archetype gives you your starting equipment. Resource Points
        represent other objects, items, and improvised equipment. Each starting
        character begins with 2 Wealth Points. Wealth Points are explained in
        more detail in later.
      </p>

      <h3>Determining Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Every character has something they want to achieve. These desires drive
        you forward, giving meaning to the actions you do. These goals are split
        into short-term and long-term ambitions.
      </p>

      <h4>Short-Term Ambition</h4>
      <p>
        A short-term ambition is something the character wants to happen soon.
        Ideally, a short-term ambition leads a character closer to completing a
        long-term ambition.
      </p>

      <h4>Long-Term Ambition</h4>
      <p>
        A long-term ambition is the character’s overarching goal. Achieving this
        goal should be considered a major turning point in that character’s
        life. Sometimes, it may be enough to convince a character to retire.
      </p>

      <h4>Achieving Goals</h4>
      <p>
        You gain experience when you complete a short-term ambition and create a
        new one. You and your entire group gain experience when you complete a
        long-term ambition. You can create a new ambition or allow the character
        to retire.
      </p>

      <h2>Experience and Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Several situations describe providing a character with experience. These
        are moments of development and advancement for characters. Experience
        allows a character to grow and learn from these moments. Each session
        provides at least one experience for the table just for participating.
        Characters also gain experience whenever the Game Master (GM) spends
        three or more Chaos at once. Every character in the group receives this
        experience. A character may have no more than nine experiences at one
        time. Any gain over this limit disappears and is no longer applicable.
      </p>

      <h3>Using Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Characters use their experiences to improve themselves. Different
        improvements will have different costs of experience. You may spend any
        amount of experience during a downtime period. It is vital to keep track
        of experience gained and spent as it may be helpful later in the
        character’s life.

      </table>
      <h3>Experience and Ranks</h3>
      <p>
        Characters gain experiences from various sources that help them improve
        themselves. Some characters have experienced enough to stand out among
        their peers. Experience ranks categorize individuals within a specific
        power scale for reference. These ranks are helpful when starting groups
        off with more experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Character Legacies</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes, characters perish. Sometimes, they decide they’ve found a
        purpose other than adventuring. It's natural for characters to leave a
        group, which may lead to new opportunities for the players.
      </p>

      <h3>Retired Legends</h3>
      <p>A character may retire under two circumstances.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The character has achieved their long-term ambition.</li>
        <li>
          The character has reached the end of an adventure and has three or
          more Injuries.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A retired character settles down in a nearby community of their choice
        and is no longer playable. They are instead an allied NPC. This causes a
        few changes for the group.
      </p>

      <h4>A Friendly Face</h4>
      <p>
        The retired friend guarantees shelter and hospitality when the group
        visits their community. A long or short rest in a community with a
        retired friend restores an extra 50% of Hope (rounded up).
      </p>

      <h4>News and Information</h4>
      <p>
        The group may contact a retired friend once per session for help.
        Contact may be in person or by alternative means available to the group.
        The group may ask the retired friend three questions about the local
        area and recent events. The Game Master (GM) provides information in
        response to the group.
      </p>

      <h4>Your Turn to Carry This...</h4>
      <p>
        A retiring character selects one item and one bond they have. The bonded
        character receives the selected item and ignores any Technique Level
        requirements. Retiring characters may repeat this for each bond they
        have.
      </p>

      <h4>Shifted Bonds</h4>
      <p>
        Any character with a bond with the retired friend changes that bond to a
        Reminiscent Bond, as shown below.
      </p>

      <h5>Reminiscent Bond</h5>
      <p>
        Note down the highest attribute the former character has. Once per
        session, a character may recall their old friend. The character may roll
        a number of d12s based on the former character’s highest attribute. Each
        success generates a single Hope.
      </p>

      <h3>Fallen Legends</h3>
      <p>
        A fallen character lives on in the memories of their friends. Any
        character who had a bond to a fallen character changes that bond to the
        Memorial Bond below.
      </p>

      <h4>Memorial Bond</h4>
      <p>
        Note down the highest attribute and approach the former character has.
        Once per session, a character may recall their fallen friend. The
        character may roll a number of d12s based on the fallen character's
        highest attribute (approach). Every success grants a single point of
        Hope and reduces a single point of Chaos.
      </p>

      <h3>New Characters</h3>
      The player may make a new character if their character has retired or
      fallen. The player creates the character as they see fit. The new
      character is another legend adding to the legacy of the world. A character
      created after the fall or retirement of another character gains
      experience. Any unspent experience of the former character goes to the new
      character. Half of the experience (rounded up) spent by the former
      character also goes to the new character.

      <h4>Advanced Archetypes</h4>
      <p>
        An adventure may need more capable starting characters. Sometimes,
        players create a new character in an ongoing game. Some characters have
        enough experience and may have access to advanced archetypes. These are
        more capable or powerful character concepts. Advanced archetypes have
        distinct abilities and statuses for an adventure. A player may select a
        advanced archetype with the Game Master's (GM's) permission. The GM may
        have introduced the archetypes during the game or as an option after a
        character legacy. Characters often learn about these advanced archetypes
        through the story. The characters may have met a member or discovered
        information about these groups. The following Advanced Archetypes cannot
        be selected until Legendary talents have been introduced to a campaign.
        The Game Master may allow this archetype. A player must spend 6
        experiences during character creation to select one of these archetypes.
